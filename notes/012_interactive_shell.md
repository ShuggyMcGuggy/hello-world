1. Demonstrate some differences between bpython and IPython for the following code:

  ```python
  for i in range(2, 10, 2):
      print(i)
  ```


* Documentation appears according to context in bpython.

* In IPython use `range?` to show documentation.

* Both have tab autocomplete.

* Last return value is stored as `_`

* IPython history supports blocks of code.
