# Have some fun!
Whilst Selenium is most commonly used for testing websites, being able to simulate a user provides plenty of fun opportunities. I've found that a good way to learn and push the capabilities of Selenium is to work on a fun project unrelated to testing.

## Examples
* Playing a canvas based helicopter game: https://github.com/davehunt/selenicopterpilot
* Playing Sudoku: https://github.com/davehunt/selenidoku
* Playing Pacman: https://github.com/davehunt/pacman
* Checking iPhone stock: https://github.com/davehunt/o2stock
* Checking event tickets availability.
* Playing a musical instrument.
