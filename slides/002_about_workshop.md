# About this workshop
This is my first workshop. I was inspired by Richard Bradshaw (http://www.thefriendlytester.co.uk/) during Selenium Conference 2016, where I assisted him with his workshop on getting started with Selenium using Java. I decided that I wanted to share the tools and practices used at Mozilla to run our Selenium automation with Python in a similar way.
