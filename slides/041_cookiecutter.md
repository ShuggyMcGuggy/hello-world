# Cookiecutter
Cookiecutter is a templating tool, and can be useful for getting started with a project. I've created a cookiecutter template for a simple pytest-selenium project implementing all of the tools covered in this workshop.

## Exercise
1. Create a new project from the template by running: `cookiecutter https://github.com/davehunt/cookiecutter-pytest-selenium`
