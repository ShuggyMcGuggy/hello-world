# Capabilities
Capabilities are a way to request certain characteristics for your browser session. For example, you can use capabilities to specify arguments when launching the browser, or to use a specific user profile. When you use a Selenium server, you often need to pass capabilities to specify the operating system and browser that you want to use.
