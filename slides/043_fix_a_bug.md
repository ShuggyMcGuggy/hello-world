# Fix a bug, become a contributor!
Selenium depends on the contributions of volunteers. You too can become a contributor by getting the source code, and fixing a bug!

## Exercise
1. Get the source code: `git checkout https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium.git`
2. Run the tests: `tox -e py36-marionette`

## Examples
* Update Python dependencies for documentation.
* Move all Python related files into `py` folder.
* Limit line lengths to 80 characters.
* Rename tests to `test_`
