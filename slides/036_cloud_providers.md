# Cloud testing providers
Instead of looking after your own Selenium Grid infrastructure, there are several cloud testing providers that take care of this for you. They also often provide additional features such as video recordings of your tests running, and a wide variety of platforms and browser support. The pytest-selenium plugin supports Sauce Labs, BrowserStack, TestingBot, and Cross Browser Testing.

## Exercise
1. Create a trial at Sauce Labs (https://saucelabs.com/signup/trial).
2. Run the tests by using the `SauceLabs` driver and a `browserName` capability of `firefox`.
