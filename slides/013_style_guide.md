# Style guide
PEP 8 (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) is the Python Enhancement Proposal for how to style Python code. It covers indentation, maximum line length, blank lines, imports, and more. Using the **flake8** package, you can check that code conforms to PEP 8 as well as checking for errors and overly complex code.

## Exercise
1. Run `exercises/013_style_guide.py`
2. Run flake8 against `exercises/013_style_guide.py`
3. Fix the issues and run flake8 again.
4. Make sure you can still run the script.
