# Explicit waits
After each simulated interaction, it's a good idea to explicitly wait for any resulting side effects to be complete. This is done by repeatedly executing a function until it meets a predetermined condition. Selenium provides examples of common conditions that you may choose to wait for, however you may occasionally also need to design your own.
