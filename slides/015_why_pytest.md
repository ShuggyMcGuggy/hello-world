# Why pytest?
I've written tests for unittest and nose, but since I started working with pytest in 2011 I haven't felt a need to use anything else. Here are a few of the reasons:

* There's no need to write test classes.
* It can run tests written for both nose and unittest.
* There's an impressive number of plugins available.
* Fixtures are incredibly powerful.
* It's a very active project with a great community.
